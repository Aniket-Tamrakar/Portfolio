              I may not be a traditional designer sketching wireframes or
              pushing pixels in design software, but I design through code. You
              &apos;ll find me deep in stylesheets, refining margins, perfecting
              layouts, and carefully crafting user experiences. Every detail,
              from spacing to responsiveness, is intentionalâ€”turning abstract
              ideas into functional and visually appealing interfaces.

              As a frontend developer, I create fast, responsive, and user
              friendly interfaces using modern frameworks like React and
              Next.js. I focus on performance, scalability, and clean code to
              deliver seamless user experiences that are both functional and
              visually appealing.
